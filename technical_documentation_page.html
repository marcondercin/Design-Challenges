      <h3 id="identify_a_need">Identify a Need</h3>
      <p>Write down all the features that you want your trail to have. Do you want it to be flowly and fast, or slow and technical? How difficult do you want the trail to be? Is it more focused on the downhill, or do you want a mix of ups and downs? Figure out what you want from the trail and then you can start to look for a suitable area.</p>
      <h3 id="contact_local_experts">Contact Local Experts</h3>
      <p>In order to find an area to build trails, contact your local mountain bike club. If your town doesnt have a mountain bike club, go to the local bike shop and find out who knows the trails best. Once you've found your local expert, tell them about your riding interests and what your area is lacking. Say that you'd like to get involved and build a trail to suit the needs of yourself and other riders like you. This is a good way to find out if there are already trails in your area that meet your needs and can help identify areas that are good for building.</p>
      <h3 id="identify_an_area_to_build">Identify an Area to Build</h3>
      <p>You can start by finding an area where it would make sense to build a trail. Maybe it will provide a connection between existing trails in a network, or connect some access roads for a fun shortcut.</p>
      <p>First, ask your local mountain bike association if they can recommend an area to build in that will suit your needs. If there are trails in your area similar to the one you have envisioned, ask if you could build in the same area. This keeps trails centralized and allows others to more easily enjoy your work. If you dont get an answer from one person, look for someone else who can help and be persistent. Ask your local mountain bike club, bike shop, riders and perhaps the best resource, other trailbuilders.</p>
      <p>It is very important that you dont build a trail anywhere you dont have permission to. This includes private land and protected areas. Unless I have permission from the land manager, I only build on crown land. Crown land is a Canadian term meaning taxpayers land owned by the government. Crown land is public land with certain laws governing its use. Find out where the government owned land is in your area by going to library or geography department of a university and looking at zoning maps. You will likely find a number crown land areas suitable for your new trail. (note: US laws are often more strict regarding public land uses) It is always a good idea to contact the crown land manager in your area before building. Crownland.org is an excellent resource if you live in Canada. Google maps is another good tool to use to identify forested areas and topography using the satellite and terrain tools.</p>

    <header>Using the right tool</header>
    <article>
      <p>There are many tools that can be used depending on your situation. Are you keeping it minimal and using the natural terrain? Or are you building a flowy jump trail with wide berms and smooth dirt?</p>
      <p>Either way, here are some tools that you can expect to see:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spade</li>
        <li>Square shovel</li>
        <li>Bucket</li>
        <li>Wheelbarrow</li>
        <li>Cutting Mattock</li>
        <li>Pulaski</li>
        <li>Chainsaw</li>
        <li>Hoe</li>
        <li>Rake</li>
        <li>Axe</li>
        <li>Hammer</li>
        <li>Folding saw</li>
        <li>Pruner</li>

    <header>Natural features</header>
    <article>
    <p>Natural features play a key role in how you will build trails. Making use of natural features saves you lots of time and effort when building your trail and it usually makes it more fun too. Different features are desirable for different trail types and uses. If you are building an XC trail, look for natural benches and humps to help you make a fast, flowy benchcut trail with many grade reversals. If you are building a FR/DH trail, look for ridges and humps with proper spacing to build jumps and berms, rock slabs, rock gardens and natural benches that make full use of elevation changes. Spotting natural features takes practice and a trained eye so next time youre out for a hike or slow paced ride, look around and try to identify a few natural features and envision what you might build with them if you were building a trail there.</p>
    <p>Some natural features that are useful in trail building:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ridgelines</li>
      <li>Benches</li>
      <li>Humps and bumps</li>
      <li>Rocks</li>
      <li>Rock faces</li>
      <li>Exposure</li>
      <li>Scenery</li>
      <li>Building materials</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="flow">
    <header>Flow</header>
    <article>
    <p>Flow is the ability to carry momentum through an entire trail without having to brake or pedal excessively. Ideally you want to pack as many features into your trail as you can while maintaining good flow. A trail with good flow will allow riders to maintain momentum from start to finish. The flowiest trails will not require riders to change speed drastically and allow riders to maintain momentum by avoiding long, steep uphills and extended straight sections. If you need to slow riders down, build a series of opposing turns.</p>
      <p>Build technical sections on a downhill slope to allow riders to maintain speed through features. One of the best ways to create flow is to include rolling uphills and downhills, or contours, throughout the trail. A rolling contour benchcut trail drains extremely well. It takes more thought and work to build a trail with flow but the final product is well worth it.</p>

    <article>
      <h3 id="drainage">Drainage</h3>
      <p>Route the trail along well drained areas. Avoid topographic low points, as these areas turn into speed sucking mud bogs. Muddy areas just get muddier and more rutted as more people ride through. Traversing a hillside is the best way to ensure that water flows off the trail, not down it. If the trail must be routed through a low lying or flat section, be prepared to dig drainage ditches.</p>
      <h3 id="ruts">Ruts</h3>
      <p>Ruts are every riders enemy. Few things in mountain biking rob riders of control like a big, rocky rut. It's your job as a trailbuilder to know how to design trails that remain rut-free for years. The principle is simple: the steeper the trail, the more prone it will be to ruts. Avoid ruts by designing trails with frequent changes in pitch. Route a trail straight up or down a hill and ruts will appear very fast.</p>
      <h3 id="walk_it_flag_it">Walk it, flag it</h3>
      <p>Walk a few different lines multiple times. This will allow you to decide which line will yield the best finished product. You will likely be spending 50-100+ hours building your new trail so choose your line wisely. Once you choose a line you can walk it top to bottom a couple times to get a good idea of what the final product will be like. After choosing the line, insert flags into the ground to mark where the trail will go. Don't stress about being exact with flag placement. The line (trail) often changes slightly during construction.</p>

      <h4>Benchcut</h4>
      <p>A benchcut trail is created by removing material from a hillside and broadcasting it down slope. This removal of material is best done with a mattock, a Pulaski, a mini front-end loader, or a mini skid steer/earth mover. When built properly, a benchcut trail provides a stable surface allowing riders to traverse the hillside.</p>
      <h4>Camber</h4>
      <p>Camber is defined as the angle of the trail perpendicular to riding direction. The camber is always sloped downhill to allow water to run across the trail rather than down it. Without the proper camber, water would channel down the trail, creating unwanted ruts. Rutting can also occur if the camber angle isnt steep enough or the trail itself is too steep.</p>
